# Making a Quiz Using JavaScript.

## Description
This project is a Quiz With Countdown Timer. The starter HTML documents were provided all with CSS style sheet. The only changes I made to the HTML document was to insert the tags for the audio and create IDs. No change was made to the CSS. I had originally included a script.js file for the questions and anothe for the scores but settled for the logic.js file to write my code and have my questions infront of me. I found this easier. This project uses query selectors that references the DOM. There are functions on how to set up the quiz and a time to score and end the game.

## Installation

## Usage

I found this project quite challenging so I would not recommend it if you are now starting out with Javascript. If you have some experience and is looking for a challenge then you can look at the project and see if you can have the same outcome by writing code in a different way. I do believe this project can be used as a reference on how to include a timer in a game or adding audio to the right or wrong answer. It also helps the user to store their score to the local staorage.
